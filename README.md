# pratice

This is a repository where I **practice my Python skills** using Jupyter Notebook. I have two notebooks in this repository:

- [a.ipynb](https://github.com/aniketh703/pratice/blob/main/a.ipynb): This notebook contains some basic Python exercises on variables, data types, operators, and expressions.
- [conditional_stmts.ipynb](https://github.com/aniketh703/pratice/blob/main/conditional_stmts.ipynb): This notebook contains some intermediate Python exercises on conditional statements, loops, and functions.

## Requirements

To run these notebooks, you will need to have **Python** and **Jupyter Notebook** installed on your computer. You can download and install them from [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) websites. Alternatively, you can use an online platform like [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) to run the notebooks in the cloud.

## Usage

To open these notebooks, you can either clone this repository to your local machine using Git, or download it as a ZIP file and extract it. Then, navigate to the folder where the notebooks are located and run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

This will launch the Jupyter Notebook app in your browser and you can open and run the notebooks from there. You can also edit the notebooks and add your own code or comments. Have fun practicing Python!
